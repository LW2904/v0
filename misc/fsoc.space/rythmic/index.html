			<i>"Koralenteprix"</i>
			<br>
			External osu!mania cheats with some experimental features. Currently
			unstable on all supported platforms, the codebase looks like a maniac
			was let loose inside.

			<b><a href="https://github.com/LW2904/mimic">mimic</a></b>
			<i>"Project Lighthouse"</i>
			<br>
			Playing around with osu! replay files. It's still in it's infancy, but 
			the idea is to allow editing and playback of 3rd party replay files.

			<b><a href="https://github.com/LW2904/athenosum">athenosum</a></b>
			<br>
			A library of more or less osu! related code to aid in cheat development. 
			Includes large parts of `maniac`'s interface, for example. Written with 
			cross-platform compatibility in mind. Desperately waiting for a large 
			rewrite.

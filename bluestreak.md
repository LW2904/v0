### Administrators
- manage the main group page.
- recruit and oversee moderators.
- act as chief judges in any conflict between members and/or moderators.
- handle group applications. *(This could be delegated to moderators.)*

### Moderators
- manage the public discussion channels. (comments, discussions, discord)
- act as relay between administration and members.

This is the optimal distribution of tasks as I see it, and it is largely in place like this in the Bluestreak group. Which is a good thing.

But, the BLS staff team is imbalanced. The current ratio of staff to members (1/10) is by far too high, and that leads to the Admin and Mod roles being nothing but status symbols because there is no "work" to do.

Note that I can only speak for the moderators here, but I very much doubt it is very different for the administrators, even if they have to handle applications.

I am a moderator in another community, with close to 5000 members, and there are 3 Administrators (of which 2 are completely backend focused) and 3 Moderators. That's 1 staff member for 1250 regular members. And it works.

Considering that by far not every member is active that ratio is probably closer to 1:200, but if you apply that same logic to Bluestreak you get 12 staff members for 24 (active) users. That's stupid.

Hell, 24 active members might actually be a bit generous: my script, which is monitoring the comment section, picked up only about 20 different SteamIDs in the last 24 hours, of which only a few made more than one post.

I realise that I am potentially endangering my own position in the staff team with this, but I just wanted to throw this out there - it's up to everyone reading this, to decide what they are going to do with this analysis.

On another note, I feel like it'd be a good idea to set up a (loose) code of conduct for staff members, but that might be going too far.

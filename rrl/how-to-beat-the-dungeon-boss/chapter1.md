He had lost count.

Time seemed to have looped eternally. 

He couldn’t remember exactly when it first started. The first time he lurked and lingered under the confines of eternal darkness. It was all a blur now. Was he born out of it? He was not entirely sure. All he knew then when he first sprung out of the void was remembering the feeling of insatiable hunger. It was a mixture of impulse and the uncontrollable desire to kill. 

There was no rhyme nor reason to it. He was just that--- a creature of rage.

He could barely recall the first time he swung his rusty dented sword against a prey. Or the first time he decapitated someone by the neck. Or the time he stabbed someone through the heart. Or through the eyes. Or to some other parts that he could practically shove his sword in to. Even through parts where the sun doesn’t shine.

Did he feel any remorse slicing up people? No. To start off, he had no conscience to speak of. So, it was forthcoming that he'd feel nothing while committing repeated gruesome acts of brutality, day in and day out. What was he supposed to feel?

Between his first fight, his first win and his first loss, he had lost track of it all.

He could not even recall as to how many times he’d died already. The countless times that his body shattered into tiny battered pieces each day, only to be revived on the next. By now, he got accustomed to it--- his own little version of the circle of life and death.

His name? He doesn’t remember them either. Wait. That was incorrect. Does he even have a name to begin with?

Indeed. The life of a lowly skeleton was hard.

It was especially harder because as an undead, being just all minerals and bones, apparently, you have no will of your own. 

Your body was not yours. Your constitution? Not yours either. There was no freedom at all. What exists are only orders, commands, and that one omnipotent 'whisper' that robs you of yourself. The whisper that robs you of everything.

"Kill them all. Kill them all for Me!"

And just like with his first, he felt the all too familiar hunger yet again.

The skeleton then turned his gaze towards the east. And like a puppet on a string, he mindlessly dragged his feet towards the origin of the smell. The sweet 'smell' of human flesh.

At the entrance of the dungeons gate, hurried footsteps could be heard from a reasonable distance. It made multiple eerie echoes, bouncing off on all of the walls of the great cave. With a loud bang, as the gigantic steel gate was closing, the noise eventually stirred the attention of the other residents of the floor. Vampiric bats disturbed the air and with uneasiness, the adventurers scurried their way through the inside of the precipice. 

"I think we should go back. I have a really bad feeling about this." suggested the young man from the back end of the line formation. He was holding a birch staff and was cloaked in crisp white linen armor with trimmings of silver from shoulder to foot. Although he was fairly medium in height, auburn and was wearing a husk type haircut that made him look silly, the young man displayed authority as he spoke. 

"Come on Rye, don’t be such a drag! This is the first floor of the dungeon for fucks sake. What else could go wrong? I mean, the monsters on this level are all pushovers."

"Will you please stop acting like a paranoid wuss all the time so we can finally grind some levels already? Just imagine and focus on the threefold experience okay. Isn't that reason enough to take a little risk? And we’re not gonna die okay captain paranoid. Geez." 

It was Mason. Dressed in ragged brown leather armor, he unsheathed his twin daggers from either side of his waist as he reasoned his way through Ryes. The assassin in training was trying his best to reassure their captain about their security and that their planned exploits today would go smoothly. 

"And besides, don’t you trust Edmond at all? He’s pretty skilled you know?" Pointing his left-hand dagger, Mason had thrown his glance over at the tall burly teen who looked very tanky while donning his crude iron-plated armor, helmet, and shield. 

Edmond gave Rye the thumbs up from the frontline of the formation. The team captain was still uneasy about the entire plan but the gesture gave him a little ease and a slight assurance of safety in his mind. 

"Alright. But remember what we have agreed on before coming here. At the first sign of danger we---"

"Yeah yeah. We bail. Yeah, we know."

"I don’t want to play the annoying upperclassman here, but I just want to make sure that we’re all on the same page. Elsie, have your spell at the ready at all times. The second you see some creature coming our way, cast the spell. You hear?"

"Yes, leader." The petit mage in black overall garb gripped her oaken staff and pulled it towards her chest as she responded. Her platinum-toned shoulder length hair bounced as she nodded in acknowledgment. 

Rye was the sort of over the top paranoid leader but Elsie understood him fully well. She understood where the guy was coming from. She knew exactly why Rye acted like a party pooper all the time. He was simply trying to preserve the lives of his entire team, hence, the overprotectiveness.

Their priest's calculated decisions saved them from certain death multiple times already. And for that, Elsie had nothing to complain about whatsoever regarding the decisions Rye had made even up to this point. In fact, she was grateful, if any, for their captains' actions.

"Illuminate." 

Out of her tiny cusped hands, the mage released a single tiny ball of light which eventually hovered above their heads three seconds later. The ball was the size of an average fist. It levitated approximately seven or eight meters in height from where the mage stood. It was akin to a floating lamp, however, mobile. 

The range of illumination wasn’t too shabby either. Its area of effect was enough for the entire team to see almost ten meters ahead of their intended direction. It was very helpful in spotting enemies from afar especially when inside the dark and gloomy confines of the dungeon. 

Vision was key. A staple for survival. Every adventurer, newbie or not, knew of this.

An hour and forty minutes in on the journey, it seemed as if everything was going according to the plan. No hiccups so far until---

"Halt!"

The warning came from Arnulfo. The squad’s archer. "I think I've heard something. No one dares fucking move or breathes okay?"

The archer quickly fell to his knees. In between nearly kissing the dirt and trying to feel the vibration of the earth with his left ear, Arnulfo assessed the incoming danger.

"60 meters ahead and fast approaching. Twenty pairs of footsteps." The archer was on his feet half a second later. His recommendation was swift. "It’s a funeral parade Captain. I think we should leave. Now!" 

Arnulfo had a valid cause to display such a worried face. The cluster of a roaming armed mob of skeletons or 'funeral parade' as they’re popularly called around these parts are nothing to joke about. There was a good reason why they called this dungeon the ‘novice killer’. 

"Oh come on! We've just got started. So far we've killed more than thirty level one skeletons on our way here. Twenty shouldn't be a big deal. They’re all level ones anyway."

"And look here, I mean all five of us are level six already, right? It can’t be that hard to destroy them." reasoned Mason.

He was frustrated with the team’s lack of guts to gamble. He just thought that it would be a waste of their effort to come all the way here and leave just barely two hours after they came in. Their experience gained at this point would not even be enough to compensate for their trouble. Not to mention their preparations.

"Did you suddenly forget where we are right now? Were inside the dungeon. And unlike outside, the mobs here are three times stronger."

"Of course I know that smarty pants."

"Hey! I'm only trying to keep our necks glued to our shoulders here and you know that. Don’t play daredevil now, friend. You're gonna get yourself and everyone else in this party killed. And that's not gonna happen. Not on my watch."

“Oi! On your three o’clock! Watch out!” shouted Edmond.

It all happened too suddenly. Five skeletons unwarningly sprung out of the dirt beneath them. It was so quick that one of the skeletons almost snatched Elsie’s head right off. Good thing however that Edmond was light on his feet.

Like a bullet in motion, the tank quickly rushed into the scene. He pushed Elsie towards the left side of the formation, successfully cutting the advance of the enemy. That, plus blocking off the three rampaging skeletons with his shield at the same time.

“Whoa that was so close!” exclaimed Elsie in disbelief.

“A little help here.” Said Edmond with a frown.

“Say no more.” Although she just recovered from being half shoved down the dirt, the mage quickly squeezed in a little spell between gasping for air while steadying her grip on the staff and standing up. ”Thousand vines--- Earth Bind!”

Multiple tentacles of thorny green vines suddenly shot up from the gravel. Each tentacle immediately coiled and subjugated the skeletons movement. The spell rendered the undead creatures immobile.

As if on cue. Edmond retreated two steps backward and prepared his stance. It was time. "Shield Smash!"

With the skeleton's armor weakened by Earth Bind combined with the mighty blow from the Shield Smash, the three skeletons crumbled into broken pieces like they were nothing.

"Holy Missiles!"

"Shadow Dance!"

Respectively, Rye and Mason each finished off an undead all on their own. They were both panting hard after that surprise bout. 

Rye, Arnulfo, and Elsie gave Mason the look. He knew exactly what those look meant right at that instant.

"I know. Lets bail. Dammit!"
 
They didn't have to discuss anything. They've done this drill a hundred of times before. They knew exactly what the risk would be if they continued to stay. It was never worth the trouble.

And just like that, the squad took off and left the dungeon in a hurry. There was no need to even look back.

At the gate, the moment that they were outside, the squad decided to take a break. Water flasks were opened and rations were distributed. Escaping made them all hungry.

"It's not here." Exclaimed Elsie as she was rummaging through her sling bag.

"What was it?" Rye followed up.

"The book that we found from the dungeon chest earlier. It's supposed to grant +25 intelligence to the user when consumed. Geez, I must have dropped it while fighting earlier. I am such a clutz!"

"Too bad. You could have easily sold it off for a decent 80 gold minus tax at the auction house."

"Yeah. Damnit. My bad. Those skeletons! Ugh! Oh well... there's no use crying over that now. At least I get to keep my life with me today."

"I agree." Rye smiled. There's nothing more precious than being alive. "Come. Let's finish here so we can start moving again. We have to reach the nearest town before nightfall."

The team nodded in unison.

Back in the dungeon, darkness ruled once again. It was quiet now. There were no adventurers to prey on.

There, at the center of the then concluded battle, a lone skeleton soldier stood on top of the broken remains of his undead comrades. He was immobile. He was silent. But then, something piqued his interest.

There appeared to be a book lying on the gravel. And from it came a low pulsating yellow light.

He was supposed to just stand there and wait for the 'whisper' to issue his next order. But then, something strange had happened. All of a sudden, the warm glow of the yellow light somehow compelled him to move on his own volition. And so, as if to rebel, he picked up the book with his two wobbly hands.

"Agathas Grimoire. If used and applied, the grimoire will grant the user an additional +25 stats points on intelligence permanently. The effect is irreversible."

"Would you like to consume Agathas Grimoire? Yes or No?"

He doesn't know what kind of demonic possession gave him the strength to choose on his own. Choice was something he was not accustomed to.

"You mentally chose yes. Commencing integration of stat points to target user. Integration starts in five, four, three, two..."

Suddenly, dazzling beams of bright lights flew out from the book. It was an explosion of colors shooting out towards every direction imaginable.

As the papers turned page by page in slow motion, the lone skeleton soaked up on all the knowledge and every information the book had to offer. Not a shred was wasted.

For what seemed like an eternity, the lights that dazzled the dungeons first floor dissolved into nothingness. Standing tall and immobile, the lone skeleton stood there dumbfounded. 

What happened next was nothing short of amazing.

"Holy Shit!"

That was the first word he had spoken on his own and not his master's.

"Am I finally free?"

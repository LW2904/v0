There are rumors going around town lately regarding a wandering deviant skeleton soldier loitering around Dungeon Anu'blahc. Witnesses swore to have sighted the peculiar undead scavenging through the remains of the deceased adventurers littered all across the different floors of the dungeon. Some had even insisted that they have sighted the thing salvage up some swords and armors down on the fifth floor.

It was beyond odd since all level one through three species group up exclusively within the confines of the first floor alone. And so, to witness one being on the fifth floor, or anywhere else on the dungeon, wandering around like a tourist, even gathering tools and weapons for god knows what reason, was beyond anyone’s comprehension.

As if to confirm the rumors being true, oddities and similar sightings continued to pour in daily through the reports desk down at the satellite office of the Adventurers Guild. And as for the way the deviant undead was behaving lately, no one knew exactly what the rationality behind it was. Could it be that the Dungeon Master was losing his grip on his minions? Possibly. Could it be there was really none to begin with? Or maybe it was just an anomaly acting like an anomaly.

At the least, the dungeon divers who'd had a firsthand encounter with the so-called deviant vouched that the creature was completely non-aggressive. It wouldn’t even bother fighting them. It just stared at the divers for one full minute, quickly lost interest, and then walked away as if they had not crossed each other’s path in the first place.

According to the divers, the creature seemed to follow a routine. After scavenging, the creature would often just find a place to hide, retreating back to the faded black where no adventurer would dare follow.

Additionally, there had been some reports making rounds in Tir'ad Pass that the deviant had somehow changed its personality overnight. Confirmed or not, the creature has been accused of abducting several stragglers. They claimed that the creature already dragged a number of unsuspecting adventurers to a secret location. It then bounds its victim before ultimately stripping them of all their valuables thereafter.

In the narrative, the only part consistent with the creature’s behavioral pattern was that it has never killed nor harmed any of its so-called captives.

One source, a friend of a friend of a former captive, swore that the skeleton would simply release the captives back to the same exact spot where they were originally abducted from. Once a captive had been dropped off by the creature, the healers had reasons to be concerned every time they rescue the victim. They've always expected for the worst case scenario every time --- that they're dead before they arrive.

However, after a close examination of those who had been returned, not a single scratch or bruise was found on any of the victims. In fact, all were alive and well.

"A minion of darkness that doesn't kill but only steals."

Gordon had not believed the crap people spewed these days, but here he was right now. He was blindfolded while his hands are behind his back with sturdy rope wound tightly on both of his wrists. His mouth was gagged while both of his feet were bound.  

It appeared to be that he was the latest victim now. So, the joke was on him.

The score so far; “crap people spew around”--- One, Gordon--- Zero.

Ah, the irony.

"My apologies about all of this. However, I felt the need to have you restrained. You see, I’m not fond of people having to scream at me in horror. Especially in close proximity. And these days, it happens quite an awful lot. It insults me. No. It hurts my feelings to be quite honest. I mean, it’s not like I have much of a choice that I look the way I look, right?"

Gordon expected it to be a deviant. It was already a given for it to act unusually. But for it to speak and to even converse fluently in the mother tongues of old Tal'amascan Empire, that part baffled him to no ends.

You don’t walk around these parts and expect to stumble upon a well-learned undead. It just didn’t make sense.

And what in blazes name was that voice?! Seriously?!

It was by far one of the top strangest sounds Gordon had ever heard in his entire existence. The creature’s speaking voice somewhat resembled the kind of sound people made when they struggle to breathe underwater.

‘The sound of a drowning man.’ He thought to himself.

It was airy, gurgly and a little bit mechanical. It was weird and creepy, but it was not quite villainy enough to send him crapping in his pants. It made his hairs raise though, that’s for sure.

“Do you mind if I have a look?” his abductor jested. There was no need for him to protest. It was pointless anyway. All he could do in his misfortune was to groan through his dirty linen filled mouth. The creature was completely free to do whatever it wanted with him.

While he lay there motionless on his side, Gordon felt a cold pressure as it reached for something from the back of his trousers' pocket.

It found his wallet.

And from the way it sounded after, the creature was clearly flipping through his papers and card stacks already.

”Alright, a guild card. Let’s see what we have here. So name Gordon Flashville; age 19; human and a Courier class. Level 8. Wow! You are strong. Not bad.”

No. Not the card!

It was never in Gordon’s nature to pray. But when he did pray, he meant it. And right now seemed like a perfect time to lift up his heart in prayers to whichever god that could hear him at this point.

Hopefully, by the time when this looting was over, the creature wouldn’t be tossing his guild card away in places where he won’t be able to find it. If that happened, then it would be the death of him.

His worries were not unfounded. Blame it on his obsession to be well-organized. Because of his obsession, he decided to deposit all of his mission credits to that one card. He trusted the advertisement too much. The convenience that it promised. And now he was probably screwed.

The dread of having to wait for four cycles in order to even get a card replacement was enough to make him sweat. Not to mention that if he did lose it, he would not be able to eat, pay for lodgings or even do equipment repairs. He will not be allowed to take missions either. He'd be stuck bussing tables for the entire year just so he could survive.

Of course, Gordon didn’t want any of that. But he could only pray for good fortune.

"Fun fact. I’ve learned how to read, speak and write just barely two months ago. Agatha’s Grimoire was truly high in quality. It taught me the basics and more.” Said the skeleton.

Gordon somehow felt that the creature tossed something away.

Was that my card? No!

“Isn't it neat? It's all thanks to that book that we’re having this wonderful conversation right now."

With my mouth gagged? Sure! Lovely. Give me back my card. Put it back you asshole! He moaned in desperation while he trashed his body on the gravel filled dirt.

"You have a very neat looking satchel Sir Gordon Flashville. I am eager to find something useful inside. Would I find something like that here? What do you think?" the skeleton teased.

The creature wasted no time at all as it started to rummage through the pile of stuff that Gordon had thoroughly accumulated over the course of many months doing missions and item trafficking.

Potions, books, talismans, low tier weapons and all sorts of performance enhancing consumables were obsessively packed neatly inside the leather sling bag.

“Whoa! I've never expected it to be this many. How did you even manage to store so many items in here? Are you a sorcerer, Mister Flashville?”

He would have answered the question right away but he remembered the ball of textile stuffing his mouth full.

In a normal setting, he would have ideally explained this to a non-academic, starting with the clarification of the puzzle behind the huge inventory space.

The secret? It was not due to a spell because it was never related to that, to begin with. It was in fact due to the innate characteristic of his unique class.

Gordon was no sorcerer. But being a Courier class adventurer gave him the ability to expand the space within a storage item: say a bag, or a treasure chest, or even drawers and closets. The ability of a courier was more rooted in alchemy or science, but never sorcery.

It was a pretty neat ability quite frankly. And thanks to that ability, it made him a highly valued asset sought after by specialized squads and raid teams.

Team leaders would often fight over him, especially during dungeon diving missions where carrying as many supplies as possible related to survival was of high importance.

With his current level, however, his ability could only store up to thirty items. It would only increase once certain conditions are met after he leveled up. In the future, if the cosmos permitted it and allowed him to live after this ordeal, Gordon hoped to grow as a traveling battle merchant someday.

But all of his aspirations right now rested upon this weird creature holding him as captive.

“Ha! I seem to have found something really good!”

The creature excitedly pulled the item out of the bag for what looked to be a large hardbound book. Black leather casing covered the entire front, back, and spine of the item. There were markings in bold red at the front that helped to reveal the title of the tome.

“The Way of Gawain: Volume One.” the creature read the text aloud, while its boney fingers glided through the embossed runes of the cover. That, as he recited each words slowly. “Sounds rich.”

With their close proximity, Gordon could feel the entire weight of the thick, unclean energy, seeping out uncontrollably from the creature behind him. He could almost imagine its grotesque smile over its fleshless face. It seems like it has gotten a little too excited about seeing the tome.

So why the hype?

Well, The Way of Gawain: Volume One, was no ordinary book. It was an item that permanently added +15 points of raw strength stats after consumption. In a world where the slightest difference in strength between two opposing force can spell either victory or defeat, a boost in a stat, no matter how small, could hold a great advantage.

Lucian is going to be really pissed once he finds out.

“I know what you were thinking Sir Flashville. Don’t fret, I am not going to wipe you clean. I’ll just take what I need and nothing more. I am magnanimous that way.”

While it bragged about its 'kindness', the creature was poking fun of him literally by using a dull dagger. He could smell the rust from the blade while the thing tested the thickness of his left cheek with it, hovering centimeters away from his nose.

Gordon started sweating profusely at the thought of dying of tetanus of all things. The dagger, he presumed, although lacking of its former sharpness, almost pierced his pasty white skin.

The advance made him wince.“Is he truly going to kill me?”

“Rest easy Mister Flashville. Your life isn’t forfeit yet. I was just teasing.” The creature then withdrew the dagger from the pudgy man’s skin, leaving a nearly punctured impression on its cheek. “Just remember, that if not for me showing you mercy today, you’d be long gone from this world already.”

The creature stood up. It moved a few steps away from Gordon, while it secured the dagger back to its scabbard.

“Let me tell you a little secret right now Mister Flashville. Just between you and me. Promise to keep it a secret okay?”

The creature paused and turned more serious.

“One day, I'm going to exit out of this place. And when I do, when the right hour comes, I'll summon you. And when I ask for you then you'd best answer me. Do you understand?!”

He was unsure as to how to correctly respond to the question since Gordon was just struck frozen there. The question lingered on his mind long after it was asked. He suddenly realized then that his ordeal with this creature wasn't going to end yet. In fact, it was just about to begin.

“Remember that you owe me your life now, Mister Flashville. Don't even try to run or hide. I'll know where you'll be at all times, trust me. I wouldn't even need eyes to find you just to be clear."

That threat just got real. Like real serious real. And did he just place a curse on me?

Gordon felt the creature step back. He can hear him doing something from behind him.

"I’m going to send you off now."

"Deep breaths, Sir Muffintop. This is going to hurt a little bit.”

And with a wild wallop, Gordon blanked out.








Personal Log No.18




When Agatha’s Grimoire freed my mind about a month and a half ago, there were things that I immediately realized.

One. My autonomy was not absolute.

There were still moments here and there, when the will of the whisper was far stronger than my own. Although it was not as often, there were times that I would completely succumb to my “Master’s” call. The struggle to disobey was proven futile half of the time.

Fortunately, there was a solution (not conclusive). Sort of a way to counter it.

Although the concept was still a theory, I had observed that the whisper’s power had somehow gotten weaker when I started to accumulate more intelligence stat points. I managed to do so by consuming another set of lesser grade books similar but inferior to Agatha's.

I needed more tests to cement this theory. But since I ran out of books halfway through the experimentation, I was unable to make any conclusion.

Also, consuming grimoires and tomes had its limit. I could only assume that I have reached a level cap, as I was no longer able to acquire more stats points even though I devoured additional books. I could only theorize that a level up had to happen first in order for me to partake for more.

Sadly, I wasted several books before finally noticing this limitation. It was a shame since it wasn't easy scavenging and stealing those books from random adventurers.

Two. I was relatively unique.

Unlike the rest of the creatures in Dungeon Anu'blahc, I was the only one capable of learning knowledge and skills from the assortment of grimoires and tomes of this world.

This information may not be entirely accurate either, but I was able to test this in by way of exposing the four other members of my cluster to stimuli--- a.k.a. the Grimoires.

I have named the four subjects as Skeleton Abe, Skeleton Bob, Skeleton Culver and Skeleton Dylan respectively. They were my exhibits A through D.

For starters, as an exposure, I allowed the four to touch and then hold the grimoires over a significant amount of time. After days of testing, however, the result came out as a disappointment. It was a pity that not a single subject responded to the stimuli. Thus, for now, I stood alone yet again.

Further research was needed. I have felt it in my gut that I could not be the only one.

Three. Cannibalism was not permissible.

A cage, no matter if it was built in gold, was still a cage. And at the end of the day, no one would willingly choose to be a prisoner.

It was the same for me. I am refusing to be held as a prisoner. I'm refusing to be a slave forever.

I needed to get out of this confinement sooner than later.

And if I wanted to get out then I needed to completely resist the call of my master. Which brought me to the idea on point number one.

Theoretically, I just needed to simply advance in terms of level in order to develop a much greater resistance to mind manipulation. If I leveled up then I could acquire more stat points. And with more stat points I'd accumulate higher chances of resistance.

Based on what I had gathered, adventurers leveled up by accumulating combat experience points. They'd achieved that by killing monsters and mobs whether on the field or inside of the dungeon. There could be other ways but that was the most common method that I had observed so far.

So with that information in mind, I’ve tested that same concept if it would work in reverse.

Using The Way of Gawain: Volume One, and with great difficulty, I managed to disembowel some adventurers hiding inside the dungeon with huge red X marks on their faces. I had no clue what those were for, but they looked really shady. It was all a waste however since I did not gain any experience points at all. Maybe the system restricted such methods from me.

A few days back, I tested the same method on Skeleton Bob instead of a human.

It was a complete and utter failure as well.

I could not even swing my sword against Bob. Somehow, the System intervened. It was preventing my every attempt to hit the test subject. I assumed that the system could pick up my hostile intent and would right away do a countermeasure before I could even make my move.

"I am not allowed to kill my own kind"—was what the System was trying to imply. That there were rules for me to follow since technically I was still a part of the system.

This result only solidified the fact that I was still a puppet on a string. And that made me all the more unhappy.

I theorized that the only way for me to break free from these shackles was to evolve. But how would I achieve such a feat?

Evolve or die trying.

Fact: adventurers were the antithesis of monsters.

In theory, if I evolve and become an adventurer, It’ll give me the tool to eliminate mobs. And if I can eliminate mobs, then I can level up. Once I can level up, I can consume more books. And if I were to consume more books, then it would mean I could gain a much higher level of intelligence. Certainly, with higher intelligence comes higher resistance. And If I can resist, then I can be free.

Sounds simple enough on paper. But I’m betting my entire spine that this plan wouldn’t be that easy.

Tomorrow night, once the monster wave event commences, it will provide me the perfect cover to get out of this place. The Master will lift the restriction of this dungeon, allowing every single monster to raze havoc outside. And that will include me.

For now, I’ll wait.

And hopefully by tomorrow night…. my theories will be proven correct.

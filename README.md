# v0
A collection of unfinished projects.

Some of these projects used to be repositories on here, and some are really just ideas that I never continued to work on.
Regardless of their origin, they will continue to live on here, for all eternity. (or until GitHub cuts the power)

## vue-stocks

Invested an afternoon in it, just to end up deleting about 80% of my code because I was unhappy with the performance. 
Oh well. Never got around to re-do it.

## vue-vocabulary

I actually worked on this for a little longer, and I use it occasionally to study french. Missing a lot of core features but I moved on.

## node-steamgroup- ...

Canceled because I got RateLimitExceeded errors all the time, I still don't know for how long they blocked my IP.
